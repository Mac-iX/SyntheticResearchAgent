**Last Updated:** January 15, 2026

This document outlines the ethical principles that govern the use of the Deep Diligent Agent (DIDI/DARA) platform ("the Service"), provided by Quality Creative Consulting, LLC.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that with great power comes great responsibility. The DIDI/DARA platform is a powerful tool for research and analysis, and we are committed to ensuring its use promotes transparency, fairness, and human well-being.

We acknowledge the ongoing ethical conversations surrounding AI and advocate for the responsible and transparent use of these tools. We encourage every user of our Service to contemplate how to use these hyper-productive intelligent tools with empathy and a commitment to not corrupt the journey of other conscious human beings.

## Prohibited Uses

You agree not to use the Service for any of the following purposes:

- **Generating Hate Speech or Discriminatory Content:** Creating content that promotes hatred, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected characteristic.
- **Creating Misinformation or Disinformation:** Generating content that is false or misleading with the intent to deceive or harm others.
- **Impersonation:** Impersonating any person or entity without their explicit consent.
- **Harassment or Abuse:** Creating content that is intended to harass, bully, or abuse others.
- **Unlawful Activities:** Using the Service for any purpose that is illegal or violates the rights of others.

## Synthetic Data and Personas

The DARA module uses synthetic data to simulate audience responses and generate personas. You acknowledge that:

- **These are not real people:** The personas generated by the Service are statistical representations based on research data. They should be used for analytical and strategic purposes only.
- **Potential for Bias:** AI models can reflect and amplify existing societal biases. You are responsible for critically evaluating the output of the Service and mitigating any potential for bias in your own work.
- **Ethical Boundaries:** Do not use the personas for any purpose that would be unethical if they were real people, such as manipulative advertising or psychological targeting.

## Transparency and Accountability

- **Disclose AI Use:** When sharing research or content generated by the Service, we encourage you to be transparent about the use of AI.
- **Verify Information:** You are responsible for fact-checking and verifying all information generated by the Service before using it to make decisions.
- **Human Oversight:** The Service is a tool to augment human intelligence, not replace it. Always apply your own judgment and critical thinking to the output.
