# DIDI/DARA Usage Guide

## When to Use Each Module

### Complete Deep Research Agent (All-in-One)

**What it does:**
Runs a comprehensive 6-phase research process with evidence-based analysis, quality review, and structured reporting.

**When to use it:**
- ✅ You need broad, preliminary research on a topic
- ✅ You want a complete research report with citations
- ✅ You're starting a new research project and need foundational knowledge
- ✅ You want to run research BEFORE using DARA modules
- ✅ You need high-quality, professional-grade output

**When NOT to use it:**
- ❌ You only need specific insights (use individual DIDI modules instead)
- ❌ You already have preliminary research done
- ❌ You're focused purely on audience research (use DARA mode)
- ❌ You want to minimize token usage (this is the most comprehensive module)

**Recommended workflows:**

**Workflow 1: Complete Research + Audience Intelligence**
1. Complete Deep Research Agent (preliminary research)
2. DARA: Foundational Research (uses output from step 1)
3. DARA: Audience Segmentation
4. DARA: Persona Generation
5. DARA: Simulated Inquiry
6. DARA: Strategic Synthesis

**Workflow 2: Quick Market Research**
1. Complete Deep Research Agent
2. DIDI: Deep Intelligence
3. DIDI: Deep Synthesis

**Workflow 3: Quality-Checked Audience Research**
1. DARA: All 5 modules
2. DIDI: Deep Quality Review (validates DARA output)

## DARA Mode

**Use DARA when:**
- You need to understand a target audience
- You want to create customer personas
- You need to simulate customer interviews
- You want strategic marketing recommendations

**Full DARA chain includes:**
1. Foundational Research (demographics/psychographics)
2. Audience Segmentation (identify distinct groups)
3. Persona Generation (create detailed avatars)
4. Simulated Inquiry (generate and answer survey questions)
5. Strategic Synthesis (product dev + messaging recommendations)

## DIDI Mode

**Use DIDI when:**
- You need deep analysis on a specific dimension
- You want modular research (pick only what you need)
- You're doing strategic business research
- You need executive-grade insights

**Individual DIDI modules:**

- **Deep Reasoning**: Multi-step logical analysis
- **Deep Interpretation**: Understanding context and intent
- **Deep Intelligence**: Information gathering and verification
- **Deep Storytelling**: Narrative presentation
- **Deep Quality Review**: Error detection and validation
- **Deep Looping**: Iterative refinement
- **Deep Signal Detection**: Filtering noise from signal
- **Deep Synthesis**: Connecting insights across domains
- **Deep Structure**: Logical organization
- **Deep Aesthetics**: Professional presentation

## Custom Mode

**Use Custom when:**
- You want to mix DARA and DIDI modules
- You have a specific workflow in mind
- You want to optimize for cost (select only essential modules)
- You're experimenting with different combinations

**Pro tip:** Start with Complete Deep Research Agent, then add specific DARA or DIDI modules as needed.

## Cost Considerations

**Approximate token usage (with GPT-4o-mini):**

| Module/Mode | Tokens | Cost |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Complete Deep Research Agent | ~6,500 | ~$0.003 |
| Full DARA chain (5 modules) | ~16,700 | ~$0.006 |
| Individual DIDI module | ~3,000 | ~$0.001 |
| Full DIDI (all 11 modules) | ~36,500 | ~$0.014 |

**Recommended for budget-conscious users:**
- Use Complete Deep Research Agent for preliminary research
- Select only essential individual modules
- Avoid running all DIDI modules unless necessary

## Quick Decision Tree

**Start here:**

1. **Do you need audience research?**
   - Yes → Use DARA mode
   - No → Continue to step 2

2. **Do you need comprehensive preliminary research?**
   - Yes → Use Complete Deep Research Agent first
   - No → Continue to step 3

3. **Do you need specific insights?**
   - Yes → Use DIDI mode and select individual modules
   - No → Use Custom mode and mix as needed

4. **Do you want to combine workflows?**
   - Yes → Use Custom mode:
     - Complete Deep Research Agent → DARA modules
     - DARA modules → DIDI Quality Review
     - Complete Deep Research Agent → Specific DIDI modules
